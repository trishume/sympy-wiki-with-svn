## About Me

My name is Tomo Lazovich. I just completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at Harvard University and am currently a 1st year in their PhD program. 

## Introduction

Before the start of this year's GSOC, SymPy had much functionality in place for working in discrete spin bases to do symbolic quantum mechanics. In fact, a whole symbolic quantum computing framework had been built on top of this foundation. One area where SymPy was lacking, however, was the ability to represent symbolic quantum states or operators in continuous bases, such as position and momentum. The goal of my project was to implement a base framework for such functionality, and example systems in multiple coordinate systems if possible.
