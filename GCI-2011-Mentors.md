Here is a list of some of the mentors for Google Code-In.  The preferred communication is through our [mailing list]() or IRC channel (#sympy on freenode).  Specific mentors may be busy at various time throughout the program, so the best way is to contact the entire community.  This is also more aligned with the way that open source development works.

**Bio**: Mateusz Paprocki is a software developer and a computer scientist. He obtained masters degree in computer science and engineering in 2010 from Technical University of Wrocław in Poland. Mateusz has been working on SymPy since 2007. His main areas of expertise are polynomials and simplification of expressions. In 2007 he was a Google Summer of Code student working on implementation of recurrence solving and symbolic summation algorithms. He was also a Google Summer of Code mentor in 2009, 2010, 2011, and participated as mentor in Google Highly Open Participation Contest in 2008. Mateusz has been a participant and a speaker of several Python scientific conferences and events (SciPy, EuroSciPy, Py4Science, ...). 

# Hector

**GitHub** : 

**Email** : hector1618@gmail.com

**Bio** : Hector (Prafullkumar P. Tale) is a final year student of 5-year Integrated M.Sc. program in Applied Mathematics at IIT Roorkee, India. He is open source enthusiast and works in scientific computing. He is one of the authors of SymPy since April 2011.

# Saptarshi Mandal

**GitHub account**: 

**Email**: sapta.iitkgp@gmail.com

**Bio**: Saptman is a graduate of IIT Kharagpur where he completed his 5-year Integrated M.Sc. program in Mathematics and Computing. He does a lot of numerical computing in Fortran using FEATFLOW for food and hacks on Sympy for fun. He was a participant in GSoC 2011 and was responsible for the creation of the combinatorics module. His area of interests are combinatorics (surprise!), optimization and differential equations.

# Joachim Durchholz

**GitHub account**: 

**Email**: jo@durchholz.org

**Bio**: Jo is a Master of Computer Science, with a few decades of practice in the software industry. He is totally green as a Sympy developer but has several years of experience as a professional software translator, so he will be mentoring translations from English to German.

# Stefan Krastanov

**GitHub account**: 

**Email**: krastanov.stefan@gmail.com

**Bio**: Stefan is a MSc physics student at École Normale Supérieure de Lyon. He has some minor contributions to the codebase concerning the physics module and plotting, but he is still new to the project. He will be mentoring mainly the translations to Bulgarian (if any), documentation tasks and maybe translations to French.

# Vladimir Perić

**GitHub account:** 

**Email:** vlada.peric AT gmail

**IRC Nick**: vperic

**Bio:** Vladimir is a Bc student of [Open Informatics]() at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague. He worked on making SymPy Python 3 compatible, as part of GSoC 2011. He is interested in the infrastructure surrounding the project, particularly the testing framework, and in outreach and popularizing SymPy. He will also mentor translations to Serbian.

# Matthew Rocklin
