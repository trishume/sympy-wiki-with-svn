Here is a list of some of the mentors for Google Code-In.  The preferred communication is through our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/sympy) or IRC channel (#sympy on freenode).  Specific mentors may be busy at various time throughout the program, so the best way is to contact the entire community.  This is also more aligned with the way that open source development works.
