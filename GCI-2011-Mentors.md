Here is a list of some of the mentors for Google Code-In.  The preferred communication is through our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/sympy) or IRC channel (#sympy on freenode).  Specific mentors may be busy at various time throughout the program, so the best way is to contact the entire community.  This is also more aligned with the way that open source development works.

**GitHub account**: https://github.com/saptman

**Email**: sapta.iitkgp@gmail.com

**Bio**: Saptman is a graduate of IIT Kharagpur where he completed his 5-year Integrated M.Sc. program in Mathematics and Computing. He does a lot of numerical computing in Fortran using FEATFLOW for food and hacks on Sympy for fun. He was a participant in GSoC 2011 and was responsible for the creation of the combinatorics module. His area of interests are combinatorics (surprise!), optimization and differential equations.

# Joachim Durchholz

**GitHub account**: https://github.com/toolforger

**Email**: jo@durchholz.org

**Bio**: Jo is a Master of Computer Science, with a few decades of practice in the software industry. He is totally green as a Sympy developer but has several years of experience as a professional software translator, so he will be mentoring translations from English to German.

# Stefan Krastanov

**GitHub account**: https://github.com/krastanov

**Email**: krastanov.stefan@gmail.com

**Bio**: Stefan is a MSc physics student at École Normale Supérieure de Lyon. He has some minor contributions to the codebase concerning the physics module and plotting, but he is still new to the project. He will be mentoring mainly the translations to Bulgarian (if any), documentation tasks and maybe translations to French.

# Vladimir Perić

**GitHub account:** https://github.com/vperic

**Email:** vlada.peric AT gmail

**IRC Nick**: vperic

**Bio:** Vladimir is a Bc student of [Open Informatics](http://informatika.fel.cvut.cz/en/for-students/bachelor-program) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague. He worked on making SymPy Python 3 compatible, as part of GSoC 2011. He is interested in the infrastructure surrounding the project, particularly the testing framework, and in outreach and popularizing SymPy. He will also mentor translations to Serbian.
