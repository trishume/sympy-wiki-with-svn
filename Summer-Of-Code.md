This page served for applying for 2007 GSoC. See [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/GSoC2007 GSoC2007] for uptodate information about !SymPy's involvement in 2007 GSoC.

For 2008, see [http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/GSoC2008 GSoC 2008].

!SymPy is a symbolic manipulation package, written in pure Python. Its aim is to become a full featured CAS in Python, while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. See http://code.google.com/p/sympy for more details.

## Detailed ideas

  * Anything in Issues
  * symbolic integration. 
  * make factorisation faster
  * asymptotic expansion
  * equations solving
  * objects with indices (tensors) 

## Other ideas

Could be found here:
