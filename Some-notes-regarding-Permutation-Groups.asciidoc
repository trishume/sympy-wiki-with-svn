== Preliminaries ==
A permutation can be represented as a function on a set of points and can also be represented in a cyclic notation. We normally do not write out cycles of length one (these are also called fixed points).
So if \[\pi = (0, 3 , 4, 1)(2)(5, 6)(7)\] then the fixed points are 2 and 7 and we rewrite it as
\[\pi = (0, 3 , 4, 1)(5, 6)\]

Multiplication of two permutations, say, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are defined by function composition that is
\[(\alpha \beta)(x)=\alpha (\beta (x))]
