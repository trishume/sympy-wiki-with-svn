# Introduction

[http://code.google.com/p/sympy/ SymPy] has participated in GSoC 2007 under the umbrella of Python Software Foundation (PSF), the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and Portland State University (PSU). Students were able to send their applications to any of those institutions and !SymPy got 11 applications in total, almost all of which were very high quality ([http://groups.google.com/group/sympy/browse_thread/thread/0b68a42be34923a4 details]). The student applications were competing with all the other at PSF, STScI and PSU. At the end, 5 best succeeded. You can find here who their mentor was, which organisation they were accepted to, their final reports and tutorials (documentation) to their projects. 

Besides their projects, they were able to form a nice team together with other !SymPy developers and we fixed many things all over !SymPy and just brought !SymPy where it is now (all 5 students successfuly finished their projects). Before GSoC, it was only Ondřej and Fabian working on it (and there was only a very small userbase), now there are 11 people with svn access and much more people using it.

Overall, it was a huge success and we owe many thanks to Google and PSF, STScI and PSU for allowing all of this to happen. We will try to participate in GSoC 2008 as well. All relevant information will be announced on the front page, so just follow the news in there.

## Other information

Students regularly updated their blogs about their progress, that are all aggregated at: http://planet.sympy.org/

You can find many interesting information in there about what was happening during the summer.

Besides that, the sympy's mailinglist and issues are the other two areas, where the development was taking place. See also SympyDevelopment.
