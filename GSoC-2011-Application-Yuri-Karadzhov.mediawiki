Title:	 SymPy: Implementing basic parametrization, symmetry search and handle module.

Student:	 Yuri Karadzhov

Abstract:	As for professional mathematician and physicist computer algebra system (CAS) mostly is the tool of handling simple yet technically large problems. Sure, it can solve some problems completely from the start to the end, but the main purpose we use CAS is to simplify our daily routine. So the goal of my project is improvement of base of Sympy which significantly reduce amount of repeated and cumbersome operations and give the basement for other more complex and specific tools.
As for me this tools are – parametrization (which helps to solve ODE's and PDE's depending on arbitrary parameters) and concerned problem of searching and handling symmetries of single ODE or PDE or system of ones.

=== Education ===



Current: PhD student in Applied math department of the Kiev Institute of Mathematics, National
Academy of Science, Ukraine.

Former: MS of mathematical physics and computer sciences in Kiev National Tars Shevchenko University (honours degree).

BA of mathematical physics and computer sciences in Kiev National Tars Shevchenko University (honours degree).



=== Current research and background ===



I have background in Computation Theory, Algebra, Mathematical and Functional Analyses , Theoretical Physics, Quantum Mechanics, Differential Equations, Mathematical Physics, Supersymmetries and Symmetries Analyses.

Currently in applied math department I study the theory of Lie groups
and it's application to the differential equations. The most recent
works however concerned with supersymmetry of Schrödinger-Pauli
equation of arbitrary dimension. The obtained results widely extend
the number of exactly solvable Quantum Mechanic problems as well as
generalize the approach of finding such problems.



=== Technical background & Programming experience ===



I've bin using GNU Linux since 2001. It is my only operation system for the last five years. I worked with  Mandriva, Red Hat, Gentoo, Debian. Now I use Kubuntu as it is simple to configure and up to date. I used to work as system administrator so I familiar with sh.

Programmer experience:
Professional:
Java EE, JDBC, JavaScript (ExtJs) – Summer work in Global Logic (2010)
Java SE – Institute project: Partial TeX translator for SIGMA journal (2009)
APL – Simcorp LLC (2008-2009)
Academic:
C/C++, Python – writing labs in University
Scala – experimenting with Processing

I have experience with SVN, Hg.



=== Mathematical Software ===



I have good knowledge of Maple, Mathematica, tried to use Sage and Maxima.
I completed the desired functionality as Maple Library and now porting it to Mathematica.
