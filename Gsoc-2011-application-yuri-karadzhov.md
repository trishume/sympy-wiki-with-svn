Title:	 SymPy: Implementing basic parametrization, symmetry search and handle module.

Student:	 Yuri Karadzhov

Abstract:	As for professional mathematician and physicist computer algebra system (CAS) mostly is the tool of handling simple yet technically large problems. Sure, it can solve some problems completely from the start to the end, but the main purpose we use CAS is to simplify our daily routine. So the goal of my project is improvement of basic operation which significantly reduce amount of repeated and cumbersome operations and give the basement for other more complex and specific tools.
As for me this tools are â€“ parametrization (which helps to solve ODE's and PDE's depending on arbitrary parameters) and concerned problem of searching and handling symmetries of single ODE or PDE or system of ones.
