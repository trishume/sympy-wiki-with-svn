#About me:
  I am currently a 2nd year PhD student at UNH. I have a BS. in mathematics with a minor in computer science from UAkron.

##Coursework:
  Undergrad: 1 year algebra, analysis, combinatorics & graph theory; 1 semester probability, topology,
  Grad: Algebra I & II, Analysis I & II, Topology I, Knot Theory*, Algebraic Geometry** (using Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms by C-L-O), Tensor Categories*, Algebraic Graph Theory* (2 semesters)
*-seminar
**-reading course

##Work Experience:
  I worked for approximately a year and a half as a junior sysadmin at the Applied Mathematics Research Lab at UAkron.

##Programming Experience:
  I started programming about 12 years with TI-Basic on a TI-83+. I have been programming in python for about 10 years; however, most of my work to date has been quite simple shell scripts and small GUI applications primarily written with PyQt. I have also written a moderately large application in VBA on top of MS Access.
  My minor in CS at Akron was primarily in Java. I did take a class in assembly language, and an independent study in bioinformatics which used perl, python, and Octave.
  I spent two summers at UIUC; the first refactoring and extending python code to visualize quasicrystals, the second writing Mathematica code to visualize fractals on sub-Riemannian manifolds.
