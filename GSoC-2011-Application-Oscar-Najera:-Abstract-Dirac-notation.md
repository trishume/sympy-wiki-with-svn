## My Information
* Name: Óscar Nájera
* University: Last year undergraduate physics student at Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Ecuador
* Short bio: As a physicist I specialize myself in computational physics, I have worked on molecular dynamics simulations and my main programming language is C/C++, but I have experience in a variety of programing technologies like: Java, bash, PHP, HTML, CSS, Matlab, Python. I just started a project in Solid State Physics/Material Science for studying and simulating Ferroelectric crystals.

## My coding Platform
I've been using Gentoo Linux for the last 5 years, except for compilations times on every update it's a really nice and customizable OS.

## My project

### Goal
Implement a framework where quantum calculations can be done using Dirac Bra-Ket Notation.
### Motivation
Dirac Notation greatly simplifies the treatment of quantum states, while working on a certain problem. But there always comes a time when calculations have to be done, that's when we use computers, but it is a tedious work to write the corresponding wavefuntion and the operator involved and then integrating over the whole space. There are many know quantum systems with analytically solved eigenstates, after implementing those solutions we could use Dirar Notation to call them and do some calculations like:
Expected values:
\( <E>=<n|H|n> \) , \(x^2 = <n|x^2\n>\)
Matrix element:
\[V_{mn}=<m|H|n>\]
Probability Amplitudes:
\(P(n)=|<n|\psi>|^2\)
