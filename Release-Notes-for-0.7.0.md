This is the changelog for the 0.7.0 release. This is a draft.  Please help fill it out.

# Backwards compatibility breaks

* This will be the last release of SymPy to support Python 2.4.  Dropping support for Python 2.4 will let us move forward with things like supporting Python 3, and will let use things that were introduced in Python 2.5, like with statement context managers.
* no longer support creating matrices without brackets (see: issue 930)
* Renamed `sum()` to `summation()` (see: 3e763a8, issues 1376, 1727). This was changed so that it no longer overrides the built-in `sum()`. The unevaluated summation is still called `Sum()`.
* Renamed `abs()` to `Abs()` (see: 64a12a4, issue 1727).  This was also changed so that it no longer overrides the built-in `abs()`. Note that because of `__abs__` magic, you can still do `abs(expr)` with the built-in `abs()`, and it will return `Abs(expr)`.
* Renamed `max_()` and `min_()` to now `Max()` and `Min()` (see: 99a271e, issue 2153)
* Changed behaviour of `symbols()`. `symbols('xyz')` gives now a single symbol (`'xyz'`), not three (`'x'`, `'y'` and `'z'`) (see: f6452a8). Use `symbols('x,y,z')` or `symbols('x y z')` to get three symbols.
* Split class `Basic` into new classes `Expr`, `Boolean` (see: a0ab479, 635d89c). Classes that are designed to be part of standard symbolic expressions (like `x**2*sin(x)`) should subclass from `Expr`. More generic objects that do not work in symbolic expressions but still want the basic SymPy structure like `.args` and basic methods like `.subs()` should only subclass from `Basic`.
* `as_basic()` method was renamed to `as_expr()` to reflect changes in the core (see: e61819d, 80dfe91)

## What other major changes?

# Everything else

* Implement symarray, providing numpy nd-arrays of symbols.
* update mpmath to 0.16
* Add a tensor module (see: [[http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/CodeGenerationReport]])
* A lot of stuff was being imported with `from sympy import *` that shouldn't have been (like `sys`).  This has been fixed.

* Assumptions:
 * Refine 
 * Added predicates (see: 7c0b857, 53f0e1a, d1dd6a3..)
 * Added query handlers for algebraic numbers (see: f3bee7a)
 * Implement a SAT solver (see: [[http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/SuperchargingAssumptionsReport]], 2d96329, acfbe75, etc.)

* Concrete
 * Finalized implementation of Gosper's algorithm (see: 0f187e5, 5888024)
 * Removed redundant `Sum2` and related classes (see: ef1f6a7)

* Core:
 * Split `Atom` into `Atom` and `AtomicExpr` (see: 965aa91)
 * Various `sympify()` improvements
 * Added functionality for action verbs (many functions can be called both as global functions and as methods e.g. `a.simplify() == simplify(a)`)
 * Improve handling of rational strings (see: 053a045, issue 1778)
 * Major changes to factoring of integers (see: 273f450, issue 2003)
 * Optimized `.has()` (see: c83c9b0, issue 1980; d86d08f)
 * Improvements to power (see: c8661ef, issue 1963)
 * Added range and lexicographic syntax to `symbols()` and `var()` (see: f6452a8, 9aeb220, 957745a)
 * Added `modulus` argument to `expand()` (see: 1ea5be8)

 * SymPy won't manipulate minus sign of expressions any more (see: 6a26941, 9c6bf0f, e9f4a0a)
 * `Real` and `.is_Real` were renamed to `Float` and `.is_Float`.  `Real` and `.is_Real` still remain as deprecated shortcuts to `Float` and `is_Float` for backwards compatibility. (see: abe1c49)

* Logic
 * implies object adheres to negative normal form
 * Create new boolean class, `logic.boolalg.Boolean`
 * Added XOR operator (^) support 
 * Added If-then-else (ITE) support
 * Added the dpll algorithm

* isympy
 * Fixed the `-p` switch (see: e8cb04a)
 * Caching can be disabled using `-C` switch (see: 0d8d748)
 * Ground types can be set using `-t` switch (see: 75734f8)
 * Printing ordering cab be set using `-o` switch (see: fcc6b13, 4ec9dc5)

* Functions:
 * Added Piecewise, B-splines
 * Spherical Bessel function of the second kind implemented
 * Add series expansions of multivariate functions (see: d4d351d)

* Series:
 * Implement a function to calculate residues, `residue()`
 * Implement nseries and lseries to handle `x0 != 0`, series should be more robust now (see: 2c99999, issues 2122-2124)
 * Improvements to Gruntz algorithm

 * `sympy.printing` now supports ordering of terms and factors (see: 859bb33)
 * Lexicographic order is now the default. Now finally things will print as `x**2 + x + 1` instead of `1 + x + x**2`, however series still print using reversed ordering, e.g. `x - x**3/6 + O(x**5)`. You can get the old order (and other orderings) by setting the `-o` option to isympy (see: 08b4932, a30c5a3)

* Physics
 * See the Quantum section

* Utilities:
 * Improve cartes, for generating the Cartesian product (see: b1b10ed)
