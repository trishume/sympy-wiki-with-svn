Title:	 SymPy: Writing a combinatorics package for sympy
Student:	 Saptarshi Mandal
Abstract:	 Sympy currently has little support for combinatorial algorithms found in such packages such as Combinatorica. I plan on implementing and maintaining such a package for Sympy.

== Synopsis ==

My Soc proposal is to implement some algorithms of Combinatorica in SymPy.

The algorithms provided in combinatorica have wide applications in fields such as information theory, theoretical computer science, cryptography and networks. Mathematica has arguably, the best implementation of a suite of combinatorial tools [1]. Another competing python CAS, Sage maintains a page indicating what aspects of Combinatorica it has implemented [SageRef]. Currently most of the algorithms presented in these packages are unimplemented in Sympy. The primary issue is the vast size of the implemented methods, many of which rely on non-trivial algorithms, which necessitates prudence in the choice of the techniques one wishes to implement.

I will be developing against the list of algorithms published in [1]. There, the algorithms are divided into 5 categories, a)Subsets and Permutations, 
b)Partitions and Compositions, 
c)Graph Construction and Representations, 
d)Graph Properties and
e)Graph Algorithms. 
I do not plan on implementing the last category as it is fairly straightforward and could be written later by other SymPy newbies as myself.

Most of the algorithms required to implement the functionality covered in (a) and (b) can be found in TAOCP Vol 4. Wherever possible (time permitting obviously) I will implement a few variations of these algorithms.

== Deliverables ==


I plan on roughly following the given schedule but uncertainty will always be there. I will however be in touch with my mentor(s) at all time.



== Community Bonding Period ==

I have been developing an integral equation solver for the past few months which have helped me learn Python and Sympy simultaneously. It mimics the functionality of intsolve in Maple and I hope to get it pushed in soon so that I will have a significant contribution to Sympy before I begin. I have a working knowledge of git. I have already begun prelim work on my project and intend to push some code onto my development branch. I also intend to read up on spectral graph theory as well as carefully reread parts of TAOCP Vol 4. I have also taken a look at the code of Sage which will be useful for the graph theoretic algorithms.

== Related Work ==

Apart from Combinatorica and Sage, maple has the combinat library. Where Mathematica really shines though is their graph visualization tools. I do not presently know how to go about this and will try to incorporate into my proposal as and when I do.

== Biographical Information ==

I am a final year student at IIT Kharagpur majoring in Mathematics and Computing. I have taken courses in Real, Complex and Functional Analysis as well as Abstract Algebra, Number Theory and Graph Theory.

I do not have any plans for the summer as I will be graduating and will be at home. I had planned a month long vacation which I will cut down to 3-4 days if I get selected.

My github account's URL is http://github.com/saptman. The relevant branches are dev_ide and combinatorics. Communicating on IRC is a bit problematic for now because of the time difference. I reply to any email as soon as I can though.
