Title: Random Variables in SymPy

Abstract: We develop the statistics functionality in SymPy, an open sounce Computer Algebra System in Python. We implement a Random Variable type and integrate it into existing SymPy functionality. By using the behavior of random variables and by leveraging the existing functionality in SymPy we hope to start a powerful statistical modeling language. 

## General Introduction 
Statistics is more important than we thought. In both social and scientific research weâ€™re scrambling to quantify and reduce error in past experiments and theories. Computational systems are also struggling to keep up with this changing paradigm - previously neglected statistical packages are dusted off and found to be lacking. Now is a time for active development. 

Numerically most solutions approach this from a data-analytic view (R, SAS, STATA, scipy.stats) or by sampling (Monte Carlo). Many statistical researchers however consider problems from a modeling perspective (regression, signals/processes, uncertainty evolution) and think symbolically (Beta = Lx + noise) and are unaware that computers could handle these symbolic problems. 

Statistical mathematical modeling can be reconciled with traditional mathematical modeling if random variables can be freely interchanged with traditional ones. I propose to build and integrate a Random Variable type and integrate it into SymPy. I hope that by leveraging the existing SymPy functionality on random variables we can build a well developed and powerful statistical modeling language. 

## Background
### Random Variables

[Random variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable) are basic building blocks of statistics and probability. They are useful in basic probability theory as well as applications where measurement error or uncertainty occurs. This uncertainty can be mathematically described as a probability distribution over a space of possible outcomes. Often we are concerned with functions on these outcomes, such as money won/lost by getting a number which is black on a roulette wheel or the expected damage done by an earthquake with value of 9 or greater on the Richter scale. These functions are random variables. Like traditional variables they can interact with functions (like sin, cos) and each other (X+Y). 

The rules for these interactions however can be quite different. They are taught briefly in school and, while they are clear to express mathematically, they involve challenging algebraic manipulations which are tedious for students for anything beyond the most basic problems. Traditionally after a few simple homework problems students switch to treating random variables as entirely abstract or entirely numerical methods. Given our strength in performing tedious algebraic manipulations this seems like a textbook use case for computer algebra systems.

### Previous Work

Random Variables have been implemented in the popular commercial CAS languages, [Maple](http://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=Statistics/RandomVariable) and [Mathematica](http://reference.wolfram.com/legacy/v5_2/Add-onsLinks/StandardPackages/Statistics/ContinuousDistributions.html). They have also been implemented in specialized though less popular statistical languages such as [APPL](http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/2001amstat.pdf).   None of these systems are open source or are freely accessible to the general public. 

This problem has been approached in the open source community from the numerical side. Motivation for this project was taken from the [Uncertainties Package](http://packages.python.org/uncertainties/index.html) which enhances numeric Python floats with single parameter uncertainty information (standard deviation). This is handy in a laboratory setting where measurements are often described by a simple x = 2 +- .3. A simple example taken from their website is printed below
```python
>>> x = ufloat((1, 0.1))  # x = 1+/-0.1
>>> print 2*x
2.0+/-0.2
>>> sin(2*x)  
0.90929742682568171+/-0.083229367309428481
```

## Work

I argue above for the importance of statistical code and I express hopes that we can build a "powerful statistical modeling language." This hope is far beyond the scope of a single Summer. In this section I state concrete goals.

Schedule:
### Prior to Code Start Date, May 23
* Familiarize myself with the existing code structure of SymPy. 
* Decide on a clear definition of Random Variables which fits well into this structure. 
* Collect algorithms for future coding. 
* Collect uses cases and requirements from statisticians and educators

### Prior to First Review, July 15
At this point I hope to have a working and self consistent implementation of Random Variables. 
* Binary Operations Like +, *, inv, Relationals (no longer bools!), 
* Standard Unary Functions like (Sin, Exp, Log) and their compositions
* RV's defined on many probability spaces
* Ensure all common distributions accounted for (Normal, Uniform, Discrete, Correlated Multivar, Pareto, T, ...) 

### Prior to Second Review, August 15
Integrate Random Variables gracefully into other parts of SymPy. The goal is to leverage existing SymPy functionality to make Random Variables powerful. This is likely to be the most challenging part of the project. This work will likely continue past the Summer.

* Linear algebra
* Physics / Quantum 
* Numerical Evaluation / Code generation

## Uses Cases
Please add any fun use cases you can think of

* Educational examples with dice. Make three dice, plot the PDF. What is the probability of an even roll?

* Uncertainty Quantification in simple systems. Provides analytical base to test numerical methods.

* For simple systems an analytical description of how uncertainty evolves may allow for clear statement about how to minimize that uncertainty. 

* Clear description of experiments, with statistical variation. 

* Quantum Mechanical states can be thought of as random variables with complex wave functions rather than distributions. Perhaps there is some crossover. 


## Requirements from SymPy
* I'll probably need to augment sympy.probability.distributions

* Applying Functions to Probability Distributions requires that they have inverses. Maybe I'm not aware of the correct syntax here but (cos(sin(x**2))).inverse() yields just "acos" and not the expected result. Are inverses of compositions possible? The inline documentation suggests that this is only a feature of sympycore. Is this easily portable?
  * The way functions are currently designed is a problem. There's basically no good way to represent a specific non built-in function, cf [issue 1688](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=1688). And this `inverse` method is seriously broken. --Ronan  
  * Is it broken beyond repair? I anticipate that I'll need to enhance other parts of SymPy to integrate Random Variables. Is fixing 'inverse' doable? --Matt
