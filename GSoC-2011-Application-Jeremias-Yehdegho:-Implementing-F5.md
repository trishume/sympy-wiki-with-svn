**Incomplete.** Sorry, I have an exam on friday that occupies my mind...

You

* Jeremias Yehdegho
* Student of mathematics ("Mathematical computer science") at the Graz University of Technology
* Short bio / overview of your background (later)
* You can contact me via:
  - Email: j.yehdegho@gmail.com
  - IRC: I'm "f1728" on Freenode
  - Jabber: jeremias.yehdegho@edu.uni-graz.at

Your Coding Skills

I consider myself to be pretty decent with C and less so with Python. I know some Mathematica, C++ and Go. Relevant courses include:

 * Introductory courses on C and C++
 * "Computer Mathematics": Mathematica, Maple, Octave/Matlab, LaTeX
 * Symbolic Computation (mostly factorization and Gr√∂bner bases): SAGE

If this is relevant: I've been using Linux exclusively for about three years.

Your Project

Implement F5B, try different selection strategies (according to the F5B paper, it works for all selection strategies), use it for simplifying rational functions modulo prime ideals (what about modules?).


Add yourself/your project with a short synopsis to the list of projects on the wiki if you have not done so yet.

    * Start a wiki page to work on your proposal.
    * What do you want to achieve?
    * If you have chosen an idea from our list, why did you choose this specific idea?
    * If you are proposing a project of your own, what is unique about it?
    * What makes you suited to carry the project?
    * How much time do you plan to invest in the project before, during and after the Summer of Code? (we expected full time
      40h/week during GSoC, but better make this explicit)
    * Please provide a schedule of how this time will be spent on subtasks of the project. While this is only preliminary, you
      will be required to provide a detailed plan latest at the beginning of GSoC and during the project you will issue weekly
      progress reports against that plan on your blog.
