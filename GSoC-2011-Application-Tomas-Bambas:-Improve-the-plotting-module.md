Biographical Information
------------------------

### Study

I study at The Faculty of Information Technology at Brno University of Technology in Czech Republic. My faculty focus on software design, programming and team projects (less theory, more practice). I have passed through many programming courses like Java, C/C++, AI Basics, Information Systems, OOP, Scripting Languages, GUI, Computer Graphics and many more. My bachelor work is called "Taroky network multiplayer game". It's the computer implementation of classic European card game (written in Python).

This is just the perfect school for making software developers. See [[http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/FIT/.en]].
