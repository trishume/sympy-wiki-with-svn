Biographical Information
------------------------

### Study

I'm studying 3rd year at The Faculty of Information Technology at Brno University of Technology in the Czech Republic. My faculty focuses on software design, programming and team projects (less theory, more practice). I have passed through many programming courses like Java, C/C++, AI Basics, Information Systems, OOP, Scripting Languages, GUI, Computer Graphics and many more. My bachelor work is called "Taroky network multiplayer game". It's the computer implementation of classic European card game (written in Python).

This is just the great school for making software developers. See [[http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/FIT/.en]].

### Coding Skills

   * Python (both 2.x and 3.x): my main language, experiences with PIL, PyQt, PyGame toolkits
   * C/C++: also good knowledges (language core, unix networking, OpenGL)
   * Java: good
   * PHP, Perl, JavaScript, Prolog, Lisp: basics

### Past Projects

I have never participated in any OSS project (except translations to czech lang, but not coding). This is my first try to get in. Anyway I have finished many small commercial projects, bespoke software (all in Python). I can send references by mail. In most cases it was some data manipulating software, like data harvesters, image manipulating scripts, import scripts, etc.
