### Study

I study at The Faculty of Information Technology at Brno University of Technology in Czech Republic. My faculty focus on software design, programming and team projects (less theory, more practice). Ihave passed through many programming courses like Java, C/C++, AI Basics, Information Systems, OOP, Script Languages, GUI, Computer Graphics and many more. My bachelor work is Taroky network multiplayer game (written in Python).

This is just perfect school for making software developers. See [[http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/FIT/.en]]
