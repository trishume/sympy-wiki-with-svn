I'll work on filling this out, this is just a template for now.

This is still a draft, if anyone has any comments or suggestions, please feel free to let me know.

## Background

Spin dynamics is an important part of dealing with quantum systems. The current implementation of spin in Sympy covers single spin states and the operators that can act on them; however, there is no means of dealing with spin states in multiple particle systems. A key to understanding these systems is Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and its generalizations to systems of more than two particles. These coefficients give the expansion of coupled spin states as a sum of product states and vice versa. Sympy currently has functions capable of calculating these coefficients numerically; this project will focus on implementing a symbolic means of manipulating these coefficients and expand the spin implementation to utilize these coefficients.

## Bio

I am a senior at the University of Minnesota and will be graduating this spring in physics and math and will begin graduate physics work next fall at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. While a student, I have taken several classes in programming; the classes I took covered C/C++ and parallel programming with CUDA. Also of note for this project are the physics classes I have taken, which include the 2 semester graduate level quantum mechanics sequence, which I will be completing this spring. Out of the classroom, I spent last summer working on developing a parallel implementation of the zlib compression library using CUDA. As for my experience with Python, beyond hobby coding, I am using Python, mainly using the PyROOT module, to do the analysis as a part of research for my senior physics thesis. While this will be the first time I will be working on an open source project, I am excited to get the chance to use my extensive physics training as a stepping stone to developing software with the Sympy community.
